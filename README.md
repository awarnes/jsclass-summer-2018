# Advanced Javascript: React.js

In this class we will spend 10 weeks learning the fundamentals of React.js and how it can be used to build Single Page Applications (SPAs) also known as web apps.

Just as it is important to know how to solve coding problems, it is vitally important to understand how to do so with a team and in an organized way. We will spend time focusing on best practices for development including, but not limited to, linting, agile practices, and source control.

# Advanced Javascript: React.js

In this class we will spend 10 weeks learning the fundamentals of React.js and how it can be used to quickly prototype and build webapps. By the end of the course you will have a finished minimum viable product (MVP) and the experience to continue building and learning into the future.

Just as it is important to know how to solve coding problems, it is vitally important to understand how to do so with a team and in an organized way. We will spend time focusing on best practices for development including, but not limited to, linting, agile practices, and source control.

### General Outline:
As we move through the course if there is anything that we need to spend more time on, or anything that we can speed through these time frames may change.
 * Basic JS moving into React.js (2-3 weeks)
 * Team Project (2 - 3 weeks)
 * Individual Projects (4-6 weeks)


### Learning React:
As we learn React together we will practice working together and how we can communicate concepts by employing [_mob programming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming).

Similar to pair programming, we will trade off 'driving' and 'directing'. One person will 'drive' by typing out what the person 'directing' suggests. Every few minutes we'll trade responsibilities in the group. This is not a closed session, and everyone is welcome to contribute (in a sane and respectful way) whether it is their turn to direct or not.

The main goals of mob programming are twofold:
  1. It is important to practice communicating complex ideas to others.
  2. Practice typing code helps to build the muscle memory and can help connect concepts to reality.

### Team Project:
Once we have a foundation of the basics for React, we can start making something meaningful! As mentioned above, part of the focus of this class is how we can develop ourselves professionally. To that end this part of the course will focus on practicing and learning React in a production like setting.

As a group we will come up with a product we would like to make. Plan what steps will be necessary to complete an MVP, paying particular attention to what features satisfy that and what are extra features. And then execute our plan as a team with each person choosing an issue/feature, writing the code, creating a PR, and resolving any conflicts, issues, or questions the rest of the team might have.

There will be times that we need to sit down as a team to learn a new technology, and times where you'll be discussing ideas or asking questions of classmates. In this way we'll be able to practice working in a team environment where everyone has a say and equal opportunity to contribute.

### Individual Project:
Building off what we learn during the team project, each student will create their own application from the ground up. We will go through the same process from concept, to planning, to execution.

During this stage it is very important to recognize what is a necessary MVP feature and what is just something that you'd like to have. There will be a hard deadline of the final day of class (September 12th, 2018) to show off these projects to the rest of the class.

### Other Information:
#### Meeting Times:
The class will meet two times per week (Monday and Wednesday nights from 6:30 to 9:30 pm). Thursday nights each week there is a frontend meetup held at PDX Code Guild. This is a time that you can go meet people currently working in the biz, ask questions, or just work on projects or homework.

#### Homework:
As much as I would like to say that a few hours a week is all it takes to learn React, that is absolutely not the case (and of course that's half the fun!). Practice makes perfect, and you will need to spend time outside of class practicing what we learn and working on your own projects in order to get as much as you can out of this class. 

Each day we will work on a warm up for a few minutes before diving into the planned class work, if you're unable to finish the warmup in the time that we have or want to continue building it out you should work on it between classes. I will also work to have additional projects to play with and work on. If you ever have any questions I will be available on slack to help as much as I can.

#### Attendance:
I will keep track of attendance for the class. If there is ever a time that you'll be out, please let me know ahead of time and that won't be a problem.

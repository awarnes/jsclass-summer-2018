## Abbreviate!

The word i18n is a common abbreviation of internationalization the developer community use instead of typing the whole word and trying to spell it correctly. Similarly, a11y is an abbreviation of accessibility.

Write a function that takes a string and turns any and all "words" (see below) within that string of length 4 or greater into an abbreviation following the same rules.

Notes:

- A "word" is a sequence of alphabetical characters. By this definition, any other character like a space or hyphen (eg. "elephant-ride") will split up a series of letters into two words (eg. "elephant" and "ride").
- The abbreviated version of the word should have the first letter, then the number of removed characters, then the last letter (eg. "elephant ride" => "e6t r2e").

Example:

`abbreviate("elephant-rides are really fun!")`

Output:

"e6t-r3s are r4y fun!"

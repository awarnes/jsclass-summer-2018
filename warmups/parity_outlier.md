## Find the Parity Outlier

An array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Given this array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

For example:
```
> outlier([2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36])
> 11

> outlier([160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21])
> 160
```

### Advanced:

Also return the index of N in the array:
```
> outlier([2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36])
> [11, 5]
```
